Euler Paths and Euler Circuits

An Euler Path is a path that goes through every edge of a graph exactly once
An Euler Circuit is an Euler path that begins and ends at the same vertex


Euler’s Theorem

1. If a graph has more than 2 vertices of odd degree then it has no Euler paths
2. If a graph is connected and has 0 or 2 vertices of odd degree, then it has at least one Euler path
3. If a graph is connected and has 0 vertices of odd degree, then it has at least one Euler circuit

	•	Degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to that vertex.

	•	In degree of a vertex is the number of edges coming towards that vertex

	•	Out degree of a vertex is the number of edges going out from that vertex. 

Undirected Graphs: 

	•	n (n - 1) / 2  is the max no of edges for any n - vertex and is said to be complete
	•	n (n -1 ) is the max no of edges for n vertex in a directed graph


Graphs are represented most commonly using: 

	1.	Adjacent matrices
	2.	Adjacency lists
	3.	Adjacency multilists


In adjacent matrix for an undirected graph, the degree of any vertex is just the sum of its row

Directed graph however, the out degree is the sum of row and in degree is sum of column
