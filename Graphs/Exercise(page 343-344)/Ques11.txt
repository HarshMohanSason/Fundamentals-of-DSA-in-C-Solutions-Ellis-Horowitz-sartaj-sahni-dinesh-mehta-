We can prove that an undirected connected graph with at least one vertex of odd degree does not have a euler path by using euler theorem 
which states that there must be 0 or 2 vertices with odd paths. 

An Euler path for an undirected graph means that all edges must be traversed only once. If we have at least one vertex with odd degree
it is not possible to start and end the walk at different circuits.
