These are the solutions for DSA book  "Fundamental of Data Structures in C++" by Ellis Horowitz, Sartaj Sahni and Dinesh Mehta. 

The directories are chapter names and the files inside them have names with ques number and page number. 

Note: 
Not all of the solutions I have written are correct and not every question is solved but i tried to solve as much as i could ;)
